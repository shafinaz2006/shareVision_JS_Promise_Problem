Write a javascript function that returns a jquery promise (deferred promise object).
Inside the function create a jquery deferred object and have an example of an ajax call (preferably using jquery).

Depending on the data returned from the ajax call (you can assume the function returns 0 or 1), either resolve or reject the deferred object. 
If the function returns 0, reject the deferred object and, if the function returns 1, resolve the deferred object.
